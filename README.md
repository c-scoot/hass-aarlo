# hass-aarlo

Asynchronous Arlo Component for Home Assistant.

The component operates in a similar way to the [Arlo](https://arlo.netgear.com/#/cameras) web site - it opens a single event stream to the Arlo backend and monitors events and state changes for all base stations, cameras and doorbells in a system. Currently it only lets you set base station modes.

The component supports:
* base station mode changes
* camera motion detection
* camera audio detection
* door bell motion detection
* door bell button press
* on the Lovelace UI it will report camera streaming state on the picture entity - ie, a clip is being recorded or somebody is view a stream on the Arlo app or if the camera is too cold to operate
* saving of state across restarts
* camera on/off
* request thumbnail updates from recording or idle camera
* direct video streaming from arlo where possible
* siren when triggering an alarm
* supports streaming in virtualenv installation

It provides a custom lovelace resource that is a specialised version of a picture-glance that allows you to see the last snapshot taken and give quick access to clip counts, the last recorded video and signal and battery levels.

**This is an alpha release - it's working great for me - 3 base stations, 11 cameras, 2 doorbells - but I haven't had chance to test it against many different configurations!**
**If I had to say where stuff might blow up I'd guess at the resource card, I've only really tested it on Chrome!**

## Notes
Wherever you see `/config` in this README it refers to your home-assistant configuration directory. For me, for example, it's `/home/steve/ha` that is mapped to `/config` inside my docker container.

Many thanks to:
* [Pyarlo](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-arlo) and [Arlo](https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo) for doing all the hard work figuring the API out and the free Python lesson!
* [sseclient](https://github.com/btubbs/sseclient) for reading from the event stream
* [Button Card](https://github.com/kuuji/button-card/blob/master/button-card.js) for a working lovelace card I could understand

## Installation

### Migrating from Old Layout
**This only needs to be done once and only if you installed an older version of `hass-aarlo`.** 

Home Assitant moved to a new layout for custom components, running the `remove_old` script will show a list of commands needed to remove the old installation. You will need to enter these commands manually. After running the command and, if they are empty, it's safe to remove the `alarm_control_panel`, `binary_sensor`, `sensor` and `camera` directories from your `/config/custom_components` directory

### Manually
Copy the `aarlo`directory into your `/config/custom_components` directory.

Copy the `www` directory into you `/config` directory.

### Script
Run the install script. Run it once to make sure the operations look sane and run it a second time with the `go` paramater to do the actual work. If you update just rerun the script, it will overwrite all installed files.

```sh
install /config
# check output looks good
install go /config
```

## Component Configuration
For the simplest use replace all instances of the `arlo` with `aarlo` in your home-assistant configuration files. To support motion and audio capture add `aarlo` as a platform to the `binary_sensor` list.

The following is an example configuration:

```yaml
aarlo:
  username: !secret arlo_username
  password: !secret arlo_password

camera:
  - platform: aarlo
    ffmpeg_arguments: '-pred 1 -q:v 2'

alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: aarlo
    home_mode_name: home
    away_mode_name: armed
    trigger_time: 30
    alarm_volume: 8

binary_sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
    - motion
    - sound
    - ding

sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
    - last_capture
    - total_cameras
    - battery_level
    - captured_today
    - signal_strength
```
The `alarm_control_panel` can be triggered and a siren, if present, will sound.

The following new parameters can be specified against the aarlo platform:

```yaml
aarlo:
  username: !secret arlo_username
  password: !secret arlo_password
  packet_dump: True
  db_motion_time: 30
  db_ding_time: 10
  recent_time: 10
  last_format: '%m-%d %H:%M'
  conf_dir: /config/.aarlo
  no_media_upload: True
  mode_api: auto
  refresh_devices_every: 0
  http_connections: 5
  http_max_size: 10
```
* If `packet_dump` is True `aarlo` will store all the packets it sees in `/config/.aarlo/packets.dump` file.
* `db_motion_time` sets how long a doorbell motion will last. Arlo doorbell only indicates motion is present not that it stops. You can adjust the stop time out here.
* `db_ding_time` sets how long a doorbell button press will last. As with motion Arlo doorbell only tells us it's pressed not released.
* `recent_time` is used to hold the cameras in a `recent activity` state after a recording or streaming event. The actually streaming or recording can be over in a few seconds and without this the camera will revert back to idle possible looking like nothing has happend.
* `last_format` is a `strftime` compatible string indicating how you want the last captured time displayed
* `config_dir` is where the component stores its state. The default is fine for hassio, docker system and virtualenv systems. You shoudn't have to change this.
* `no_media_upload` is used to workaround Arlo issues where the camera never gets a media upload notification. Most people will not need this.

For `alarm_control_panel` you only need to specify the modes if you have custom mode names, see [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/arlo/#alarm) for more information. Names are case insensitive.

Now restart your home assistant system.

### Special Options

Use these only if asked to:
* `no_media_upload`: some people have seen the Arlo servers dropping stream connections and no image updates when recording stops, if you see this then set this variable to `True` in `aarlo` platform.
* `mode_api`: Aarlo will pick the mode api to use based on the device type. You can override this by setting this option to `v1` or `v2` to use the old or new version exclusively. The default is `auto`, choose based on device.
* `refresh_devices_every`: Some people are seeing mode changes failing after several days of use. If you set this value to a non zero positive integer Aarlo will refresh its device once every that many hours. The default is `0`, no refreshing.
* `http_(connections|max_size)`: Adjust the number of allowed http connections. Set both to 0 to use the global https pool. The default is 5 connections and 10 max.

## Resource Configuration

*This piece is optional, `aarlo` will work with the standard Lovelace cards.*

The new resource `aarlo-glance` is based on `picture-glance` but tailored for the Arlo component to simplify the configuration. To enable it add the following to the top of your UI configuration file.

```yaml
resources:
  - type: module
    url: /local/aarlo-glance.js
```
You configure a camera with the following yaml. The `show` parameters are optional but you must have atleast one.

```yaml
type: 'custom:aarlo-glance'
entity: camera.aarlo_front_door_camera
name: Front Door
show:
  - motion
  - sound
  - snapshot
  - battery_level
  - signal_strength
  - captured_today
  - image_date
top_title: false
top_status: false
top_date: false
image_click: play
door: binary_switch.front_door
door_lock: lock.front_door_lock
door_bell: binary_switch.aarlo_ding_front_door_bell
door2: binary_switch.front_door
door2_lock: lock.front_door_lock
door2_bell: binary_switch.aarlo_ding_front_door_bell
```

You don't need to reboot to see the GUI changes, a reload is sufficient. And if all goes will see a card that looks like this:

![Aarlo Glance](/images/aarlo-glance-02.png)

Reading from left to right you have the camera name, motion detection indicator, captured clip indicator, battery levels, signal level and current state. If you click the image the last captured clip will play, if you click the last captured icon you will be show the video library thumbnails - see below. Click the camera (not shown) will take a snapshot and replace the current thumbnail.
The states are:
* `Idle` camera is doing nothing
* `Turned Off` user has turned the camera off
* `Recording` camera has detected something and is recording
* `Streaming` camera is streaming live video other login
* `Taking Snapshot` camers is updating the thumbnail
* `Recently Active` camera has seen activity within the last few minutes
* `Too Cold!` the camera is shutdown until it warms up

The `door` options are useful if the camera is pointed at a door. And `top_title` and `top_status` move the title and status to the top to clear some space at the bottom for small displays.

Clicking on the last captured clip will display thumbnail mode. Clicking on a thumbnail starts the appropiate video.  You can currently only see the last 99 videos. If you move your mouse over a thumbnail it will show you time of capture and, if you have a Smart subscription, a reason for the capture. **>** takes you to the next page, **<** to the previous and **X** closes the window.

See the [Lovelace Custom Card](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/lovelace_custom_card.html) page for further information.

## Streaming

The support for stream is experimental and works but with a couple of caveats.
* virtualenv only - this is because `ffmpeg` doesn't support rtsps streams in docker or hassio.
* the stream only stops if you use the aarlo-glance card

Do get streaming working in `virtualenv` you still need to make sure a couple of libraries are installed. For `ubuntu` the following works:
```
source your-env/bin/activate
sudo apt install libavformat-dev
sudo apt install libavdevice-dev
pip install av==6.1.2
```
Set `image_click` to `play` on the aarlo glance card.

## Other Lovelace Options

Using the conditional card you can have badges of cameras appear after activity or if they go off line. I use the following to get quick updates on an overview view.

```yaml
cards:
type: vertical-stack
  - card:
      show_state: false
      type: glance
    entities:
      - entity: camera.aarlo_front_door_camera
        name: Front Door
      - entity: camera.aarlo_front_camera
        name: Front
      - entity: camera.aarlo_driveway_camera
        name: Driveway
      - entity: camera.aarlo_back_door_camera
        name: Back Door
    show_empty: false
    state_filter:
      - recently active
      - streaming
      - recording
    type: entity-filter
  - card:
      show_state: true
      type: glance
    entities:
      - entity: camera.aarlo_front_door_camera
        name: Front Door
      - entity: camera.aarlo_front_camera
        name: Front
      - entity: camera.aarlo_driveway_camera
        name: Driveway
      - entity: camera.aarlo_back_door_camera
        name: Back Door
    show_empty: false
    state_filter:
      - 'offline, too cold'
      - turned off
    type: entity-filter
```
When things happen it will look something like:

![Recent Activity](/images/activity.png)

## Automations

The following example automation will update the image 3 seconds after a recording event happens.

```yaml
- id: 'automation-0100'
  alias: Camera Snapshot
  trigger:
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2
    for: 00:00:03
    from: 'idle'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2
    for: 00:00:03
    from: 'recently active'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data_template:
      entity_id: "{{ trigger.entity_id }}"
    service: camera.aarlo_request_snapshot
```

## Services
The component provides the following extra services:

- `camera.aarlo_request_snapshot(entity_id)`
  * `entity_id`: camera to get snapshot from

  This requests a snapshot be taken. Camera will move from `taking_snapshot` state when finished.

- `camera.aarlo_request_snapshot_to_file(entity_id,filename)`
  * `entity_id`: camera to get snapshot from
  * `filename`: where to save snapshot

  This requests a snapshot be taken and written to the passed file. Camera will move from `taking_snapshot` state when finished.

- `camera.aarlo_stop_activity(entity_id)`
  * `entity_id`: camera to get snapshot from

  This moves the camera into the idle state. Can be used to stop streaming.

- `alarm_control_panel.aarlo_set_mode(entity_id)`
  * `entity_id`: base station
  * `mode`: custom mode to change to

  Set the alarm to a custom mode.

## Web Socket

The component provides the following extra web sockets:

- `aarlo_video_url(entity_id)`
  * `entity_id`: camera to get video details from

  Request details of the last recorded video. Returns:
  * `url`: video url
  * `url_type`: video type
  * `thumbnail`: thumbnail image url
  * `thumbnail_type`: thumbnail image type

- `aarlo_library(at-most)`
  * `at-most`: return at most this number of entries

  Request up the details of `at-most` recently recorded videos. Returns an array of:
  * `created_at`: unix time stamp
  * `created_at_pretty`: pretty version of the create time
  * `url`: URL of the video
  * `url_type`: video type
  * `thumbnail`: URL of the thumbnail
  * `thumbnail_type`: thumbnail type
  * `object`: object in the video that triggered the capture
  * `object_region`: region in the video that triggered the capture

- `aarlo_stream_url(entity_id,filename)`
  * `entity_id`: camera to get snapshot from
  * `filename`: where to save snapshot

  Ask the camera to start streaming. Returns:
  * `url`: URL of the video stream

- `aarlo_snapshot_image(entity_id)`
  * `entity_id`: camera to get snapshot from

  Request a snapshot. Returns the image.
  * `content_type`: the image type
  * `content`: the image

- `aarlo_stop_activity(entity_id)`
  * `entity_id`: camera to stop activity on

  Stop all the activity in the camera. Returns:
  * `stopped`: True if stop request went in


## To Do

* custom mode - like SmartThings to better control motion detection
* enhance live streaming
* use asyncio loop internally
* setup pypi
